    # Your service may have a healthcheck endpoint that tells you if the service is functioning.
    # You may not want to enforce limits on requests to this endpoint. Either because such a request
    # failing could generate (false) alerts or because it could cause an upstream loadbalancer to take
    # this endpoint out of its set of available backends.
    # To that end, we define here an example ACL for such an endpoint, which we then use further down in the
    # 'http-request activate-weir' line to exclude this request from the rate limiting mechanism.
